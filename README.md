# HELLO-WORLD
Welcome to my GitHub account. This is just a new repository

GitHub is a web-based version control and collaboration platform for 
software developers. GitHub is a cloud based hosting service that lets
you manage git repositories.
Git simplifies the process of working with other people and makes it
easy to collaborate on projects.
Team members can work on files and merge their changes in with the 
master branch of the project.
